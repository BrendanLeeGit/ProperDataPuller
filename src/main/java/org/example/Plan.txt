Ability to translate different file formats like XML and JSON into a universal data type

make sure this universal datatype is traverseable and changeable in different ways

JSON Reading:
We're gonna take everything as strings, and these strings can be sent to a factory to become actual objects

Actualy I lied, we'll make several objects
    -Each datatype will extend abstract JSONDatatype
        -This ensures I can hold several in one array together
    -Each datatype will have:
        -A String as an identifier
        -The associated data, whether it's an array or smt else

    -How to store several things in a JSON object such as an unlimited amount of strings, integers, and booleans?
        -Datatypes include:
            -a string
            -a number
            -an object (JSON object)
            -an array
            -a boolean
            -null
        -Objects have an arraylist of the datatype :)

    -Need to make the object navigable
        -Use casting depending on the instance? Kinda questionable ngl but we'll see I suppose
        -You only ever need to dive into arrays and objects
            -Make a way to delve deeper into objects
            -Give array search methods

        -How to tell the difference between an oject and a stirng and stuff if we're hlding them as JSONObjects??
            - Utilize instance of like
                    JsonDataType test = new JsonString("Hi","Bye");
                    System.out.println(test instanceof JsonString);

                    every object will be it's own tree? idk
